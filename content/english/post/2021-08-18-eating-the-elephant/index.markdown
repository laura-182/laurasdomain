I built my first website when I was 13 from the public library's computer in basic HTML on Angelfire. After that I was commissioned to build websites for two local restaurants and a florist. It was fun.

Flash forward 20-some years... Building this website - less fun. Gotta be honest, I beat my head against the wall one long weekend trying to make all the pieces work together. But we made it.

Some things I learned along the way...

- **Stage, Commit (and message), then Push:** Git and GitHub took some getting used to. I mean, now it's all fine and great but figuring out the right order and commands and abbreviations was more confusing than I expected. I'm used to jumping in and picking up online platforms right away, figuring it out as I go, but this was different. It wasn't until I walked step by step through [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/) that things started making sense.
