description: what i'm about
---

I want to make things more efficient for good people doing good things. I want to make complex policies and programs accessible and approachable for everyone. Most recently that's meant data wrangling and grant applications for a chamber/economic development/core district organization in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

I grew up in a small town, tried out a city, and landed somewhere in between. I love eating local, finding cool plants, and buying good books that I'll probably not get around to reading for a few years.

I care about maintaining a planet that's beautiful and diverse. I attempt to balance eating well with eating _well_. I love learning about history and especially separatist movements. I dream about moving to Europe.

I studied political science then urban and regional planning with a specialization in workforce and economic development. I did a stint in digital marketing agencies. _Never. Again._

I'm a proud nerd at heart.
